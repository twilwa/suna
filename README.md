## Project Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](docs/images/diagram.png)

Suna consists of four main components:

### Backend API
Python/FastAPI service that handles REST endpoints, thread management, and LLM integration with OpenAI, Anthropic, and others via LiteLLM.

### Frontend
Next.js/React application providing a responsive UI with chat interface, dashboard, etc.

### Agent Docker
Isolated execution environment for every agent - with browser automation, code interpreter, file system access, tool integration, and security features.

### Supabase Database
Handles data persistence with authentication, user management, conversation history, file storage, agent state, analytics, and real-time subscriptions.

## Run Locally / Self-Hosting

Suna can be self-hosted on your own infrastructure. Follow these steps to set up your own instance.

### Requirements

You'll need the following components:
- A Supabase project for database and authentication
- Redis database for caching and session management
- Daytona sandbox for secure agent execution
- Python 3.11 for the API backend
- API keys for LLM providers (OpenAI or Anthropic)
- (Optional but recommended) Tavily API key for enhanced search capabilities

### Prerequisites

1. **Supabase**: 
   - Create a new [Supabase project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects)
   - Save your project's API URL, anon key, and service role key for later use
   - Install the [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started)

2. **Redis**: Set up a Redis instance using one of these options:
   - [Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com/) (recommended for cloud deployments)
   - Local installation:
     - [Mac](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/redis): `brew install redis`
     - [Linux](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/install-redis-on-linux/): Follow distribution-specific instructions
     - [Windows](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/install-redis-on-windows/): Use WSL2 or Docker
   - Save your Redis connection details for later use

3. **Daytona**: 
   - Create an account on [Daytona](https://app.daytona.io/)
   - Generate an API key from your account settings
   - Go to [Images](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/images)
   - Click "Add Image"
   - Enter `adamcohenhillel/kortix-suna:0.0.20` as the image name
   - Set `/usr/bin/supervisord -n -c /etc/supervisor/conf.d/supervisord.conf` as the Entrypoint

4. **LLM API Keys**:
   - Obtain an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) or [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/)
   - While other providers should work via [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm), OpenAI and Anthropic are recommended

5. **Search API Key** (Optional):
   - For enhanced search capabilities, obtain an [Tavily API key](https://tavily.com/)
  
6. **RapidAPI API Key** (Optional):
   - To enable API services like LinkedIn, and others, you'll need a RapidAPI key
   - Each service requires individual activation in your RapidAPI account:
     1. Locate the service's `base_url` in its corresponding file (e.g., `"https://linkedin-data-scraper.p.rapidapi.com"` in [`backend/agent/tools/data_providers/LinkedinProvider.py`](backend/agent/tools/data_providers/LinkedinProvider.py))
     2. Visit that specific API on the RapidAPI marketplace
     3. Subscribe to the service (many offer free tiers with limited requests)
     4. Once subscribed, the service will be available to your agent through the API Services tool

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kortix-ai/suna.git

# Supabase credentials from step 1
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

# Redis credentials from step 2
REDIS_HOST=your_redis_host
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=your_redis_password
REDIS_SSL=True  # Set to False for local Redis without SSL

# Daytona credentials from step 3
DAYTONA_API_KEY=your_daytona_api_key

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:8000/api"
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```
